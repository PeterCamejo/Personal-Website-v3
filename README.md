//Next.js + ChakraUI + Framer Motion stack idea from https://www.craftz.dog/

Previous versions: v1, v2

My current personal website, built with a Next.JS, ChakraUI, and Framer Motion stack. This is my first personal website built with React and I had a lot of fun with it. In particular, I was really glad to be able to work with an animation library for React since I am currently trying to further my skills and knowledge in both web animations and React.
