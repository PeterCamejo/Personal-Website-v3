My current personal website, built with a Next.JS, ChakraUI, and Framer Motion stack. This is my first personal website built with React and my first full project using Next.js and I had a lot of fun with it. I was very pleased with how clean and modular my code and file structure ended up, but I know there are probably really basic ways that I am not using Next.js to its fullest potential that I am unaware of. In particular, I was really glad to be able to work with an animation library for React since I am currently trying to further my skills and knowledge in both web animations and React. Currently, the biggest sort of spaghetti code comes from the animations. A big todo for this site right now is to clean up the animation code using Framer Motion variants.

To get the site running locally on port 3000 after cloning, run:
```
npm install
npm run dev

```
